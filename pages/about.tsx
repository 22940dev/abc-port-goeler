            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hey I'm Patrick Goeler, a business informatics student from Mannheim, Germany.
                Besides my studies I work for <Link href="https://aioneers.com/">Aioneers</Link> as
                a Software Engineer üë®‚Äçüíª. My studies are coming to an end though, as I'm working on my
                master thesis in the area of microservices. Fun fact: My full name is "Patrick
                Goeler von Ravensburg", hence the domain name, but that's way too long for any
                username üòÇ.
            </p>
            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I started to work very early during my studies to complement the curriculum with
                hands-on experience and industry practice. All positions were as a working student
                which allows me to work full-time during the semester break (like an internship) and
                continue working with reduced load during the semester.
            </p>
